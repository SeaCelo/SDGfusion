		Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
Ocean conservation and the sustainable use of oceans continue to require effective strategies and management to combat the adverse effects of overfished stocks, increasing ocean acidification and coastal eutrophication. In addition, increases in the extent of protected areas for marine biodiversity and intensification of research capacity and ocean science funding remain critically important to the preservation of marine resources.Fishery resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate change and overfishing. The proportion of world marine fish stocks that is within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013.Marine protected areas are known mechanisms for ensuring the conservation of the ocean. As at January 2018, 16 per cent (or over 22 million km2) of marine waters under national jurisdiction (that is, 0 to 200 nautical miles from shore) were covered by protected areas, more than doubling in extent since 2010. Protection of marine key biodiversity areas has also increased, with the mean coverage now 44 per cent compared with 30 per cent in 2000.Scientific knowledge and related research capacity are essential to underpin the sustainable management of the ocean and its resources. In an assessment in the Global Ocean Science Report, the responses from 26 countries from all regions of the world for 20092013 were analysed, and it was found that government funding for ocean science only ranges from <0.04 per cent to 4 per cent of national research and development funding.
