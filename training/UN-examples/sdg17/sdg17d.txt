		Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development
Goal 17 seeks to strengthen global partnerships to support and achieve the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda, bringing together national Governments, the international community, civil society, the private sector and other actors. Despite some advances in certain areas, more needs to be done to accelerate progress. All stakeholders will have to intensify and focus their efforts on the areas where progress has been slow. 
		Finance
Taxation is an important instrument in financing domestic development activities. However, the regions most in need of resources still face challenges in collecting taxes. The rate of taxation (ratio of tax revenue to GDP) in the least developed countries declined from a peak of 11.1 per cent in 2012 to 8.8 per cent in 2016. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa faced a similar trend: a decline from 14.9 per cent in 2006 to 10.7 per cent in 2016.In 2017, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD totalled $146.6 billion, a decrease of 0.6 per cent from the 2016 level in real terms. ODA as a share of donors gross national income remained low, at 0.31 per cent. Only five Development Assistance Committee countries  Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom  met or exceeded the United Nations benchmark for ODA contributions of at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income. Remittances sent by international migrants to their home countries in the form of personal transfers and compensation of employees have declined to $538 billion (0.72 per cent of global GDP) in 2016 from $555 billion in 2015. Recent trends of stricter immigration policies in many migrant-destination countries continue to constrain the flow of remittances.Debt service as a proportion of exports of goods and services has been on the rise for five consecutive years in the least developed countries: from a low of 3.5 per cent in 2011 to 8.6 per cent in 2016. The recent upward trend followed a decade-long decline in debt service from its height of 13.4 per cent in 2001. The ability to sustainably service debts out of export earnings is crucial for countries most in need of resources for development.
		Information and communications technology
Despite the worldwide increase in fixed broadband subscriptions, access to high-speed connections remains largely unavailable in the developing countries. In 2016, high-speed fixed broadband penetration reached 6 per cent of the population in developing countries, compared with 24 per cent in developed countries. Limitations in the capacity and speed of fixed broadband connections will affect the quality and functionality of this development tool and widen the already existing inequalities.
		Capacity-building
Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $20.4 billion in 2016 and represented 18 per cent of total aid allocable by sector, a proportion that has been stable since 2010. Of the total, Latin America and the Caribbean received $5.1 billion, sub-Saharan Africa received $4.6 billion and Southern Asia received $3.8 billion. The three main sectors assisted were public administration, environment and energy, which received a total of $10.2 billion.
		Trade
The latest available data show that tariffs applied under preferential trade agreements, which include bilateral and regional free trade agreements, have been declining over time. In 2016, the trade-weighted average preferential tariff rate applied to imports from the least developed countries was 7.9 per cent, a 2 percentage point drop from the 2005 level. For developing regions, the average preferential tariff rate dropped by 1.2 percentage points during the same period.The stagnation in global trade since 2011 has been followed and accompanied by a break in the expansion of the world market shares of developing regions and the least developed countries. The developing regions share in world merchandise exports declined for two consecutive years: from 45.4 per cent in 2014 to 44.2 per cent in 2016, in sharp contrast to an average annual 1.2 percentage point increase from 2001 to 2012. For the least developed countries, the share of world merchandise exports decreased from 1.1 per cent to 0.9 per cent from 2013 to 2016, compared with the rise from 0.6 per cent to 1.1 per cent from 2000 to 2013.
		Systemic issues
Development partners should align their support with Governments national development strategies and results frameworks, in particular in fragile countries in respect of countries own policy space and path towards sustainable development. In 2016, 82 per cent of new development projects had objectives aligned with national priorities. However, more than half of the projects relied on parallel systems and data to monitor progress and development results, instead of integrating these efforts as part of national statistical and monitoring systems. In 2016, 81 developing countries undertook national exercises to monitor development effectiveness, demonstrating their commitment to strengthening the means for Sustainable Development Goal implementation and the quality of multistakeholder partnerships. Half of the countries showing overall progress are fragile States and small island developing States.
		Data, monitoring and accountability 
In 2017, 102 countries or areas were implementing national statistical plans. Sub-Saharan Africa remains at the lead of implementation with 31 countries implementing such plans; however only 3 of them were fully funded.In 2015, developing countries received $541 million in financial support from multilateral and bilateral donors for all areas of statistics. This amount accounts for only 0.3 per cent of total ODA, short of what is needed to ensure that countries in developing regions are better equipped to implement and monitor their development agenda.Population and housing censuses are a primary source of disaggregated data needed to formulate, implement and monitor development policies and programmes. During the 10-year span from 2008 to 2017, 89 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.
148.	The coverage of birth and death registration and the completeness of vital statistics remain a challenge, even among countries with functioning civil registration systems. For the period 20122016, 143 countries have birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete and 148 countries have death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 8 out of 53 countries have birth registration data that are at least 90 per cent complete, and only 9 out of 53 countries have death registration data that are at least 75 per cent complete.
