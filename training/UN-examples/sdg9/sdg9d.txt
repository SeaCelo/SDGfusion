Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
To achieve inclusive and sustainable industrialization, dynamic and competitive economic forces need to be unleashed to generate employment and income, facilitate international trade and enable the efficient use of resources. The global share of manufacturing value added in GDP increased from 15.2 per cent in 2005 to 16.3 per cent in 2017, driven by the rapid growth of manufacturing in Asia and reflecting the continuing recovery from the recession of recent years. Although the share of manufacturing in GDP in the least developed countries continued to grow, reaching 12.3 per cent of GDP in 2017, the manufacturing value added per capita in the least developed countries was only $109, about one fortieth of the amount registered in Europe and Northern America. The share of manufacturing in total employment has declined from 17.6 per cent in 1991 to 13.2 per cent in 2016.Globally, carbon dioxide emissions intensity decreased by 19 per cent in 2015 to 0.31 kg carbon dioxide per dollar from 0.38 kg carbon dioxide per dollar in 2000. This trend was evident in manufacturing industries as well, with global manufacturing intensity declining at an average annual rate of over 2 per cent from 2010 to 2015.Global investment in research and development grew at an annual average growth rate of 4.5 per cent from 2000 to 2015, reaching $1.9 trillion (purchasing power parity), or 1.7 per cent of global GDP, in 2015.The number of researchers worldwide has been growing at an average annual rate of 3.7 per cent from 2000 to 2015, meaning that there are 1,151 researchers per 1 million inhabitants. This value varies widely between regions, from 96 per 1 million inhabitants in sub-Saharan Africa to 3,639 in Europe and Northern America.Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $56 billion in 2016, a slight decrease since 2015 but an increase of 27 per cent in real terms since 2010. The main recipient sectors continue to be transport and energy.An increase in the share of medium-high and high-tech industries in total manufacturing value added can indicate a countrys capacity to introduce new technologies in other sectors as well. In 2015, medium-high and high-tech sectors accounted for 44.7 per cent of manufacturing value added globally and reached 34.6 per cent in developing economies, up from 21.5 per cent in 2005.Most mobile subscribers worldwide now have access to higher-quality networks. By 2016, the proportion of population covered by a 3G mobile broadband network stood at 61 per cent in the least developed countries and 84 per cent globally. If this trend continues, the least developed countries are on track to reach over 90 per cent mobile broadband coverage by 2020.
