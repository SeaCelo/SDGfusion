Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Ensuring access to affordable, reliable and modern energy for all has come one step closer as a result of recent progress in increased access to electricity, in particular in the least developed countries, and improvements in industrial energy efficiency. However, national priorities and policy ambitions to deliver energy for all continue to be needed, to put the world on track to meet the energy targets for 2030.From 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without access to electricity dipping to just below 1 billion.Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has gradually improved, to reach 59 per cent globally in 2016, up 10 percentage points since 2000. Even with this progress, 3 billion people are still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. Key barriers to increased access include high user costs for many of the cleaner cooking solutions, limited infrastructure, lack of consumer awareness of the benefits of clean cooking and limited financing for producers seeking to enter the clean fuel and stove markets. Renewable energy consumption increased to 17.5 per cent in 2015, up slightly from 17.3 per cent in 2014 as the growth in renewables outpaced the growth in overall energy consumption. Most of the increase came from bioenergy and the continued expansion of wind and solar energy, driven by falling costs and policy support. Reducing energy intensity (the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP) is crucial for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions and making energy more affordable. Global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent in 2015 from 2014, double the rate of improvement seen from 1990 to 2010. To reach the Sustainable Development Goal target, global energy intensity needs to improve at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent over the period 20162030, necessitating a significant ramp-up in global policy ambition to keep up the momentum.
