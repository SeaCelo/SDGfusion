Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
As much progress has been made in the health domain throughout the world, many more people currently have healthy lives than they did in previous decades. Nevertheless, far too many people die prematurely and preventable diseases still take many peoples lives. Correcting this requires concerted efforts, focusing on the demographics and regions that have been left behind. 
		Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health
In 2015, an estimated 303,000 women throughout the world died as a result of complications of pregnancy and childbirth, with a global maternal mortality ratio of 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Almost two thirds of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. In the period 20122017, almost 80 per cent of live births worldwide took place with the assistance of skilled health personnel, one of the most critical interventions, up from 62 per cent in the 20002005 period. The greatest progress was made in Central and Southern Asia, from 40 per cent to 77 per cent. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest coverage, at 58 per cent, in the period 20122017. Worldwide, child mortality has declined substantially in recent decades. Globally, the under-5 mortality rate dropped to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016 from 78 in 2000, a 47 per cent decline. The total number of under-5 deaths dropped to 5.6 million in 2016, from 9.9 million in 2000.The neonatal mortality rate (the mortality rate for children under 28 days of age) fell by 39 per cent, from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 in 2016. The number of neonatal deaths declined from 4 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2016. In 2016, sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia had the highest neonatal mortality rates, at 28 deaths per 1,000 live births. Access to modern contraceptive methods is important for the well-being of women of reproductive age (1549 years of age). Globally, among women of reproductive age who are married or in a union, the proportion whose demand for family planning is satisfied by using modern contraceptive methods increased from 74.9 per cent in 2000 to 77.4 per cent in 2018. Progress has been more significant in the least developed countries, where this proportion increased from 39.4 per cent in 2000 to 58.5 per cent in 2018. Childbearing in adolescence has declined steadily in almost all regions but remains high in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, the adolescent birth rate was 44 births per 1,000 women aged 1519 years globally, with the highest rate in sub-Saharan Africa, at 101.
		Infectious diseases
Globally, HIV incidence has declined from 0.40 to 0.26 per 1,000 uninfected people from 2005 to 2016, due in part to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, which sharply reduces onward transmission of HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily impacted by HIV, with HIV incidence rates at 1.28 per 1,000 uninfected people. For women of reproductive age in the region, the rate is even higher, at 2.58 per 1,000 uninfected people.The world is not on a trajectory towards ending malaria by 2030  in fact, the trends are worrisome. In 2016, there were 216 million cases of malaria, compared with 210 million cases in 2013. There were 140 new cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people in 2016, compared with 173 cases per 100,000 people in 2000. In 2016, 1.5 billion people were reported to require mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.6 billion in 2015 and 2 billion in 2010.The widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic hepatitis B virus infections  as reflected by the decline in hepatitis B prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre-vaccine era to 1.3 per cent in 2015.Unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene continue to be major contributors to global mortality and caused around 870,000 deaths in 2016, mainly from diarrhoeal diseases, but also from malnutrition and intestinal nematode infections. Among those, 329,000 deaths occurred in children under 5 years of age. Sub-Saharan Africa and South-Eastern Asia bear the highest disease burden.
		Non-communicable diseases and mental health
Globally, 32 million people died in 2016 from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease. The probability of dying from these diseases from 30 to 70 years of age was about 18 per cent in 2016. Nearly 800,000 suicide deaths occurred in 2016, a figure unchanged from the previous year. Male suicide rates are 75 per cent higher than female suicide rates, with the highest rates in Europe, where male suicide rates are at 27.6 per 100,000 population, compared with 7.3 for women.Consumption of alcohol and tobacco has many detrimental effects on health, exacerbating the effects of non-communicable diseases. In the period 20152016, only 14 countries of the 181 that ratified the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control improved their national monitoring of tobacco use, in accordance with article 20 of the Convention. In 2015, 34 per cent of men and 6 per cent of women aged 15 and older used smoking forms of tobacco. In 2016, the average annual consumption of pure alcohol was approximately 6.4 litres per person among individuals 15 years or older. Europe and Northern America, together with Australia and New Zealand had the highest consumption, at approximately 10.6 litres per person in 2016. Air pollution, whether indoor (household) or outdoor (ambient) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute lower respiratory infections. In 2016, air pollution from household and outdoor air pollution led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa, most of Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), have the highest mortality rate from air pollution.
		Other health risks
Road traffic accidents killed 1.25 million people worldwide in 2013 and injured up to 50 million more.Unintentional poisonings were responsible for over 100,000 deaths in 2016, with a steady decline over the past two decades and rates still relatively high in low-income countries.
		Health systems and funding
Globally, almost 12 per cent of the worlds population spent at least 10 per cent of their household budgets to pay for health services in 2010, up from 9.7 per cent in 2000.Immunization is one of the worlds most successful and cost-effective health interventions. Despite the increase in coverage with the required three doses of combined diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine from 72 per cent in 2000 to 86 per cent in 2016, an estimated 19.5 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases. The global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is yet to reach 50 per cent. Coverage with the second dose of measles-containing vaccine increased from 10 per cent in 2000 to 64 per cent in 2016.Official development assistance (ODA) for basic health from all donors has increased by 41 per cent in real terms since 2010 and reached $9.4 billion in 2016. In 2016, about $1.9 billion was spent on malaria control, $871 million on tuberculosis control and $2 billion on other infectious diseases, excluding HIV/AIDS.Available data from 2005 to 2016 indicate that close to 45 per cent of all countries and 90 per cent of the least developed countries have less than one physician per 1,000 people, and over 60 per cent have fewer than three nurses or midwives per 1,000 people.Under the International Health Regulations, all States Parties are required to have or to develop minimum public health capacities to implement the Regulations effectively. According to the 167 responses from the 196 States parties, countries achieved an average rating of 71 per cent for all capacities associated with implementation of the Regulations in 2017.
