		Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Decoupling economic growth from resource use has been challenging. Addressing this will require policies creating conducive environments, social and physical infrastructures and markets, as well as a profound transformation of business practices along global value chains. In 2018, 71 countries and the European Union reported on their macro policies, regulatory, voluntary or economic instruments that support the shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. Taking other sources of information into consideration, a total of 109 countries have or had national policies and initiatives relating to sustainable consumption and production. Domestic material consumption gives an indication of materials used in production processes within an economy. Domestic material consumption per unit of GDP changed globally from 1.2 to 1.1 kg per dollar of GDP from 2010 to 2015, indicating that fewer materials are required to produce a unit of output. However, domestic material consumption in absolute terms is also growing globally, with consequences in terms of both resource pressures and associated environmental impacts. Parties to the international multilateral environmental agreements are required to transmit information on the implementation of their obligations under the agreements. However, while the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer has a 100 per cent compliance rate, followed by the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade (71 per cent), compliance rates for the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants are at only 57 and 51 per cent, respectively.
