Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries
Efforts have been made in reducing income inequality for some countries, increasing zero-tariff access for exports from the least developed countries and developing countries and providing additional assistance to the least developed countries and small island developing States. However, these improvements will need to accelerate in order to reduce growing disparities within and among countries.For the income gap within countries to decrease, the incomes of those at the bottom of the income distribution must grow more rapidly than those at the top. From 2010 to 2016, in 60 out of 94 countries with data, the incomes of the bottom 40 per cent of the population grew faster than those of the entire population. The voting share of developing countries in many international organizations remained largely unchanged in 2017, as negotiations on governance reform are still ongoing. Some minor increases in the voting share of developing countries were observed at the International Monetary Fund (from 37.2 per cent in 2016 to 37.7 per cent in 2017) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, part of the World Bank Group, (from 37.9 per cent in 2016 to 38.8 per cent in 2017) as a part of previously agreed reforms.In 2016, over 64.4 per cent of products exported by the least developed countries to the world and 64.1 per cent of those from small island developing States faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20 per cent since 2010. For developing countries, duty-free market access existed for about 50 per cent of all products exported in 2016.In 2016, total receipts by developing countries from donor countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), multilateral agencies and other key providers were $315 billion, of which $158 billion were ODA. In 2016, total ODA to the least developed countries and small island developing States from all donors equalled $43.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. While ODA to small island developing States in 2016 showed an increase of 41 per cent in real terms from 2015, this was largely attributable to debt relief for Cuba, which was the largest recipient ($2.7 billion).Remittances represent an important source of income for many families in developing countries. Of the $538 billion in total remittances recorded in 2016, $407 billion went to low- and middle-income countries. While the global average cost of sending money has gradually decreased in recent years, it was estimated to be 7.2 per cent in 2017, more than double the target transaction cost of 3 per cent.
