Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
The year 2017 was one of the three warmest years on record, and the average temperature was 1.1 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Analysis by the World Meteorological Organization shows that the five-year average global temperature for the period 20132017 was the highest on record. The world also continues to experience rising sea levels, the most costly North Atlantic hurricane season on record and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, necessitating urgent and accelerated action by countries as they implement their commitments for the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to prepare nationally determined contributions, in which they outline their approaches and actions to lower greenhouse gas emissions, enhance adaptation and build climate resilience. As at 9 April 2018, the Paris Agreement had been ratified by 175 parties, and 168 parties (167 countries and the European Commission) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.In addition, as at 9 April 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted the first iterations of their national adaptation plans, advancing various activities for formulating and implementing such plans in response to climate change.Developed country parties continue to make progress towards reaching the goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020, and are encouraged to continue their efforts to channel a substantial share of public climate funds into adaptation activities and to strive to achieve a greater balance between finance for mitigation and for adaptation, thereby recognizing the importance of adaptation finance.
