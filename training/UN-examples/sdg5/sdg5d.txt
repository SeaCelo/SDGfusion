Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
While some forms of discrimination against women and girls are declining, gender inequality continues to hold women back and deprives them of basic rights and opportunities. Empowering women requires addressing structural issues such as unfair social norms and attitudes, and progressive legal frameworks that put men and women at the same level.According to data from 2005 to 2016 in 56 countries, one in five ever-partnered adolescent girls aged 1519 years have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the 12 months prior to the survey.New data confirm that the practice of child marriage has continued to decline around the world, largely accounted for by the progress in Southern Asia; in that region, a girls risk of marrying in childhood has declined by over 40 per cent since around 2000. Globally, around 2017, about 21 per cent of women from 20 to 24 years were married or in a union before the age of 18.Female genital mutilation is a human rights violation affecting girls and women worldwide, but in particular in communities in which it persists as a social norm. On average, approximately one in three girls aged 15 to 19 has been subjected to female genital mutilation in the 30 countries where the practice is concentrated around 2017, compared with nearly one in two around 2000.According to data from about 90 countries, from 2000 to 2016, on an average day, women spent about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men, and significantly more if they had children.Globally, the percentage of women in single or lower houses of national parliament has increased from 19 per cent in 2010 to around 23 per cent in 2018, with the lowest rate in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), at 5.6 per cent, and the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean, at around 30 per cent. In three quarters of the 79 countries with data available around 2016, less than 38 per cent of senior and middle management positions are occupied by women, with the lowest rates in Northern Africa and Western Asia and in Central and Southern Asia.The right of women and girls to make key decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and access to sexual and reproductive health services is key to their well-being. According to the latest available data for 47 countries from 2007 to 2016, just over half (53 per cent) of women aged 15 to 49 years who are married or in a union make their own informed decisions about these issues.
