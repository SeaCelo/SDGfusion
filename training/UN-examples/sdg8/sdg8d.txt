Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Although, globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, in particular for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequalities (in particular in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth.Globally, in 2016 real GDP per capita grew at 1.3 per cent, less than the average of 1.7 per cent growth rate recorded in the period 20102016. For the least developed countries, the rate fell sharply, from 5.7 per cent in the period 20052009 to 2.3 per cent in the period 20102016.Labour productivity at the global level, measured as output produced per employed person in constant 2005 United States dollars, grew by 2.1 per cent in 2017, the fastest growth registered since 2010. This was driven by strong productivity gains in Oceania, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, but partially offset by modestly negative growth in Africa.Workers in informal employment have higher exposure to pervasive decent work deficits and a higher risk of being in working poverty. Globally, 61 per cent of workers were in informal employment in 2016. Excluding the agricultural sector, 51 per cent of all workers were in informal employment, with a higher prevalence registered among men (53 per cent) than women (46 per cent).A study of data from 45 countries shows that earnings inequalities are still pervasive: in 89 per cent of the countries, men earn on average more than women per hour worked, with a median gender pay gap of 12.5 per cent.The global unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent in 2017, down from 6.4 per cent in 2000, with a slower decline since 2009, when it reached 5.9 per cent. Youth are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults, with the global youth unemployment rate at 13 per cent in 2017.In half of the 74 countries with data available around 2016, over 17 per cent of young persons are not in education, employment or training, with no noticeable reduction in this share since the financial and economic crisis. Recent data from over 70 countries show that the prevalence of occupational accidents is still a cause for concern around the world, with a median of 4 fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 employees and a median of 911 non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 employees. From 2010 to 2016, the number of automated teller machines per 100,000 adults increased from 39 to 59 worldwide. Asia reported the highest increase. In contrast, over the same period, the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults worldwide hovered around only 14.5, due in part to the expansion of non-bank financial intermediaries and the growth of digital financial services.Ownership of a financial account  whether through a financial institution such as a bank or a mobile money provider  is a basic measure of access to financial services. In high-income countries, almost every adult has an account, compared with only 35 per cent of adults in low-income countries. Women lag behind men on account ownership across all regions.In 2016, aid for trade commitments decreased to $51 billion from $55.2 billion in 2015, but was still more than double the baseline commitments of 20022005. The decline was highest in the energy sector (falling by $2.4 billion), banking and financial services (falling by $1.3 billion) and the agriculture sector (falling by $1 billion).
