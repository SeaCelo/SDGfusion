Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Critical efforts are needed to improve the quality of education. Disparities in education along the lines of gender, urban/rural location and other dimensions still run deep, and more investments in education infrastructure are required, particularly in the least developed countries.In 66 countries with comparable data for the period 20092017, around two in three children aged 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy-numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and learning.At the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010, with considerable variation across countries and regions: the lowest rates were in sub-Saharan Africa (41 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (52 per cent).It is estimated that 617 million, or 58 per cent, of children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. About two thirds of them attend school but are not learning, either because they drop out or because they do not learn the basics.Disparities based on location and wealth generally favour the urban and the rich. For example, according to data from 62 countries for 20012015, only 12 countries show parity between urban and rural children in achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading or mathematics at the end of primary education.The least developed countries face the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic infrastructure. In 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in the least developed countries had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 37 per cent of primary schools, 52 per cent of lower secondary schools and 55 per cent of upper secondary schools have access to electricity.Qualified teachers are key for progress in education quality and learning. In 2016, according to estimates for primary education, 85 per cent of teachers worldwide were trained  only 71 per cent in Southern Asia and 61 per cent in subSaharan Africa.ODA for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016. Institutions in Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and European Union accounted for two thirds of this total.
