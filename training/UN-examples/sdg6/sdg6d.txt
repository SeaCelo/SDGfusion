Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Too many people still lack access to safely managed water and sanitation facilities. Water scarcity, flooding and lack of proper management of wastewater hinder social and economic development. Increasing water efficiency and improving water management are critical to balancing the competing and growing water demands from various sectors and users.In 2015, 5.2 billion people used safely managed drinking water services  an improved water source located on the premises, available when needed and free from contamination  which represents 71 per cent of the global population. An additional 1.3 billion people (17 per cent of the global population) used a basic drinking water source  an improved water source not more than 30 minutes away. This means that 844 million people around the world still lack even a basic level of service.According to estimates from 84 countries, in 2015, 39 per cent of the global population used safely managed sanitation services  basic facilities that safely dispose of human waste. An additional 29 per cent of the global population used a basic sanitation service  an improved facility that is not shared. In 2015, 2.3 billion people still lacked even a basic level of service and 892 million people continued to practise open defecation, resulting in a decline from 20 per cent in 2000 to 12 per cent in 2015. In 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in the least developed countries had basic handwashing facilities.Untreated wastewater degrades water quality, posing risks to public health, contaminates drinking water sources and limits opportunities for safe and productive reuse of water. Preliminary estimates from household data of 79 mostly high and high middle income countries (excluding much of Africa and Asia) show that 59 per cent of all wastewater flows are safely treated, 76 per cent of flows are safely treated in households with a sewer connection and 18 per cent of flows are safely collected and treated for those with on site facilities only.In 22 countries (mostly in Northern Africa, Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia), water stress  defined as the ratio of fresh water withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources  is above 70 per cent, which indicates a strong probability of future water scarcity. In 15 of these countries, withdrawals totalled more than 100 per cent of the renewable freshwater resources in the country.In the period 20172018, 157 countries reported an average implementation of integrated water resources management of 48 per cent.According to data from 62 out of 153 countries sharing transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 20172018, and only 17 countries reported that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements.ODA for the water sector was $9 billion in 2016. While disbursements from 2011 to 2016 increased, as commitments fell, disbursements may also decrease in the future. Any reduction in external aid is likely to hamper progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6, as a 2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of countries reported insufficient finances to attain national WASH targets.
