Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
After a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise again. Conflict, drought and disasters linked to climate change are among the key factors causing the reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and malnutrition by 2030 more difficult. It is estimated that the undernourishment rate increased to 11 per cent in 2016 from 10.6 per cent in 2015. This represents an increase, to 815 million, of undernourished people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. According to the Food Insecurity Experience Scale of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which directly measures the difficulties faced by people in accessing food, in 2016, 689 million people in the world (9.3 per cent of the world population) reported experiencing severe food insecurity. Malnutrition manifests itself in various forms and has serious long-term consequences for the worlds children. While declining in almost every region, stunting (being too short for ones age) globally affected 22 per cent of children under 5 years of age  151 million children in 2017. Three quarters of these children lived in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2017, 51 million children under 5 years of age suffered from wasting  low weight for ones height  and 38 million were affected by obesity.Conserving the genetic diversity of plants and animals provides the basis for adapting livestock populations to future changes in environmental conditions or in the demand for products and services. At the end of 2017, global holdings of seed and other plant genetic materials conserved in 90 countries and 16 regional and international centres totalled 4.89 million samples, representing a 1 per cent increase over the previous year.Investments in agriculture are crucial to help improve the sectors productivity. However, government expenditure in the agricultural sector, measured by government expenditure in agriculture divided by the sectors share of gross domestic product (GDP), fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.23 in 2016 worldwide.Aid to agriculture in developing countries has fallen, from nearly 20 per cent of all donors sector-allocable aid in the mid-1980s to only 6 per cent, or $12.5 billion, in 2016.Progress has been made in reducing subsidies that distort the world agricultural markets. Agricultural export subsidies more than halved in 5 years, from $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015.Volatility in food prices can have a negative impact on food security. In 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, while in 21 countries, prices for one or more cereal products (maize, wheat, rice, sorghum/millet) were at high or moderately high levels. Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest number of countries, with high levels of both food prices and cereal prices. Declines in domestic output, currency depreciation and insecurity accounted for such high price levels.
